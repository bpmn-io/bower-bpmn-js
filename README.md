# Discontinued

Starting with `bpmn-js >= 0.27.0` we will no longer be publishing new releases of our bower bundles.

Use pre-packaged UMD versions of bpmn-js hosted on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/bpmn-js/dist/) instead.

Checkout our new [pre-packaged example](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-examples/tree/master/pre-packaged) for additional information.
